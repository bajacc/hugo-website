**! website under construction !**

Nothing to see here yet

Welcome on my website without bloat. Here you will find no `hugo`, `react` or `jekyll`.
This website was build from my modified version of `ssg6` using `lowdown` (`pandoc` is way too bloat)

The website design was stongly inspired by <https://fmash16.github.io/index.html>. Many thanks.

### Update 20 January 2023 

The previous message was from my old website. I decided to choose the dark side of bloatness. This website was built using hugo and the blowship template. Wanted to be minimal is something to fight for, but having to reinvent the wheel every time we want to make a small change on a website give us a considerable disavantage compare to someone who does not care about bloatness and _make things work_. 

For those who want to see what this website use to look like, here is a picture:

This website will not be exactly the same, but I am going to come back to that palette of color.
